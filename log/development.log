  Parameters: {"authenticity_token"=>"[FILTERED]", "post"=>{"title"=>"How do you live below your means? Earning 6 digits but barely saving", "description"=>"Before I start, please don’t judge me. I understand this may come off as tone deaf to some, so be warned! You can stop reading here.\r\n\r\nI am 25 years old and I grew up upper middle class. When I went to college, my allowance was around 5,000 pesos a week purely spent on food (I had a driver and a credit card for non-food purchases). I was used to shopping every week. My friends were the same and I grew up like that, travelling a lot, getting gifted designer bags, etc.\r\n\r\nNow that I’m older I realize what the value of money is. I would say I’m a HENRY (high earner, not rich yet). My gross pay monthly is 130,000 but my lifestyle is expensive. Here’s a breakdown of my expenses:\r\n\r\nFood/groceries - 10,000 pesos (I live alone) Bills - 8,000 (3,000 MERALCO, 500 internet, 1,000 phone, 2,500 doctor & maintenance medications for psoriasis) Gym - 10,000 (I have a personal trainer) Sinking fund for gifts - 3,000 Sinking fund for non essentials - 20,000\r\n\r\nI don’t pay for rent because my relatives own the condo I’m in, and I have a car lent by my parents for transportation.\r\n\r\nI think my non essential fund is already generous. I looked up what most people budget and sometimes it’s even less than 10,000. My problem is, sometimes I even go over my budget because of how much I was used to my old lifestyle. To the point where I end up spending my entire salary without setting anything aside…\r\n\r\nEating at restaurants for 1,500-5,000 seems “normal” to me. Spontaneous trips that I haven’t budgeted for? I will go, we never know when a pandemic will strike again. Unexpected expense while on the trip? We might as well, we’re already here! That’s my usual line of thinking.\r\n\r\nI know that the most common advice is of course, just stick to your budget. I want to get good advice on how I can psychologically stop? I try to stick to my budget and feel deprived. I have a high earning, stressful job so I often treat myself to pretty things or good food. I track all my expenses but it really just ends there. When I try to reflect on what I could’ve done better, I don’t feel any remorse because for me, the expenses made me happy and I don’t really throw my money on things I end up not using.\r\n\r\nI also want to emphasize that I’m not in debt, I just barely save. My parents offer to pay for some of my bills but I don’t want to rely on them, as much as possible I want to build good money habits as tempting as it is. Please give any reasonable advice on how I can start? Again, this might come off very privileged. I’m very thankful for this but I know I can do better, hence the post.", "name"=>"Name"}, "commit"=>"Update Post", "id"=>"5"}
